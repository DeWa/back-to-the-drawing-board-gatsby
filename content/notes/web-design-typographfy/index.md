## Font family

Avoid using more than 3 different fonts.

The fonts should complement each other and you should make a hierarchy among them.

- **Primary font** will be used in headers. This is usually the most prominent one and it should complement the font used in the logo.
- **Secondary font**. This will be used on the body text so it should be easily readable even on a small screen.
- **_Accent font_** This font will be used on buttons and everywhere where you want to catch the visitor's attention. This font is highly optional as you can use primary font here as well.

Sans-serif or serif font? Historically serif fonts have been used for magazines, books, and long texts because they help the eye travel across a line. Sans-serif on the other hand are great for headings. This isn't always true as it's depending on the font you choose.

## Color

In text, the most important aspect for the colors is contrast (especially in the a11y point of view). [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) has a great tester to check working contrast between different colors. The W3C recommends the following contrast ratios for body text and image text:

- Small text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background.
- Large text (at 14 pt bold/18 pt regular and up) should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against its background.

## Line spacing

Line spacing makes the text more readable. <mark>Line-height should be about 120-150% of the character height.

## Font size

Modular font sizes make your text a harmonious look. Usually this scale is (in pixels) 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 95. The best body text size depends on the screen resolution and the distance the viewer is watching the content. The general rule is something like this

- **Mobile** 12-16pt
- **Tablets and HD-monitors** 15-19pt
- **UHD-monitors** 16-20pt'

## Line length

Long line lengths can cause fatigue in a reader so it's best to keep your content in 45-75 characters per line.
